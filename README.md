**OVMEMU IS STILL IN THE PRIVATE CODING STAGE!! OPEN SOURCE CODE WILL BE RELEASED SOON!!**

# Open VM Emulator
OpenVMEmulator is an open-source program that makes your computer looks like a VM to VM-Resistant malware.

# How OVMEMU works
* **Emulated Guest Additions:** OVMEMU runs basically empty programs that resemble the Guest Additions that a program that VirtualBox or VMWare would use.
* **Fake Registry Keys:** OVMEMU adds Registry Keys in the Windows registry that resembles the ones that Guest Additions would add after installation.

# Why did I create OVEMU?
OVMEMU was a project I made because a similar project was closed-source, and I prefer to use open-source programs, so I wrote this as a sort-of open-source clone.
